Use multi-stage builds to create smaller production images: FROM node AS builder
Try BuildKit for faster builds: export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
Use .dockerignore patterns to exclude node_modules and build artifacts
Try COPY package*.json before npm install for better layer caching
Use specific base image versions instead of :latest for reproducibility
Try alpine-based images for smaller size: node:18-alpine
Use docker-compose.override.yml for local development settings
Try healthchecks in docker-compose to auto-restart unhealthy containers
Use named volumes instead of bind mounts for better performance
Try docker volume prune to clean up unused volumes
Use --no-cache flag when dependencies change: docker build --no-cache
Try docker stats to monitor resource usage of running containers
Use depends_on with condition in docker-compose for startup order
Try env_file in docker-compose to load environment variables from file
Use docker save and docker load to backup/transfer images
Try docker commit to create new image from running container changes
Use --memory and --cpus to limit container resource usage
Try docker network create for custom networks between containers
Use docker logs --since 1h to see recent logs only
Try docker system df to see disk usage by images, containers, volumes
